Problems found:

- The ports of untrusted elements need to be specified as well. This is needed in order to specify connections in app's
manifest file.

- trusted elements are not really compatible with each other if connected directly, e.g. Microphone -> VoiceRecognition -> App
In this case the outgoing port of Microphone sends an event to the VoiceRecognition element. The VoiceRecognition is
triggered by this event, runs the voice recognition but outputs an event on a completely different port that connects to
the untrusted app element. OR element is the same. It outputs on a different port then the ports that receive the inputs.

- OR element can have several input ports depending on the use-case. We need to have a ways to specify dynamic port number for
some of the elements. OR element also has strict only-input and only-output ports.

- Some elements like KV Store or GraphVisualization elements operate with unknown data types. We can't be sure about the
type of data they receive on their inputs and/or outputs. This can only be guessed by knowing what elements were used
previously or what data types the untrusted app element had access to before, which is again quite speculative. This is a
serious problem - we can't reason about the leakage of personal data if we don't know for sure which data type the untrusted
element operates with, moreover if there are several of them.

- the app manifest needs to specify what event (or event on which port) triggers the execution of the application. In case of
voice assistant it's a output of the speech recognition element
